about_description: "Computing Science undergraduate student at the University of Alberta.
Working at the Maple lab under Dr. Karim Ali during the summer/fall of 2019."

about_me: "I was born in Chisinau, Moldova, and my family immigrated to Canada in 2004. I grew up in small farming town in North-Eastern Saskatchewan. During my childhood, I spent just as much time behind a computer as I did working with my hands; whether it was working on cars with my dad, landscaping, or working on construction projects. I graduated high school in 2016, and moved to Edmonton to study at the University of Alberta."

research_area: "I am interested in program analysis tools that can be deployed and used by developers in the industry. I put high priority in making software usable and maintainable. Unlike many current program analysis tools and frameworks, I want my work to be well documented and easy to integrate into developers workflows and development processes."

projects:
  - name: SWAN - A program analysis framework for Swift
    description: SWAN is the first open source static program analysis framework for Swift meant to enable analysis such as CHA, call graphs, pointer analysis,taint analysis, etc. The translator is written in C++, hooks into the Swift compiler, translates the raw SIL to WALA CAst, and passes the translated IR up to the analysisengine built on top of WALA and written in Java. Currently, I am the main contributor to SWAN.

  - name: Swasar - Swift implementation for Phasar
    description: This project is an attempt at implementing taint analysis on pure Swift applications using the LLVM static program analysis framework, Phasar. LLVM IR generated from the Swift compiler is fed to a modified Phasar analysis to find the presence of taints in the Swift source code. The taint analysis was successful, but using an LLVM analysis framework is not ideal for analyzing Swift applications.

  - name: QuickTopo
    description: I currently lead a team of 3 other developers under the name Prairium. We are working on developing an independent commercial solution, QuickTopo, to address a bottleneck in the topological surveying process, especially in the area of agriculture. I have developed and used a prototype for this software when I was working as a surveyor for Greentree Engineering. We hope any surveyor needing to do a significant topological survey can utilize our tool to save time and money.

  - name: CloudCity - A city building game written for HackEd 2019
    description: My team and I developed a simple city building game about population management using openFrameworks.

  - name: CAT - Cluedo Assistant Tool
    description: I made a simple desktop application using WPF to assist in keeping track of moves and cards in the game of Cluedo.

  - name: DoctorPlzSaveMe - a medical app developed for CMPUT 301 (Intro to Software Engineering)
    description: I took on the role of project lead and backend developer for this course project. We developed an app that allows users to track/record their medical issues and receive feedback from a care provider.

  - name: Starcraft 2 bot - a bot developed for CMPUT 350 (Advanced Game Programming)
    description: I helped develop a bot based on CommandCenter, and pitted it against other teamsâ€™ bots. I worked on siege tank and resource gathering AI.

  - name: Black Hole Visualizer
    description: I attempted to visualize a spinning black hole using openFrameworks for an ASTRO creative assignment. It was difficult to do, but the result is good enough to roughly represent how particles are affected by a black hole. This work was later presented at a teaching conference by one of the course coordinators.

  - name: Laser Tag Pistol
    description: I 3D-printed, built, and programmed a custom laser tag pistol. It uses a Teensy for a micro-controller, produces various sounds, has LED animations, and can receive/send unique IR signals (to be able to differentiate between teams, for instance).

  - name: Automatic deadbolt unlocker
    description: I 3D printed, built, and programmed a remote-based automatic deadbolt opener for my dorm.
